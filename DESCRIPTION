Description: It just provide functions to simulate the SIR epidemic
    dynamics model on the network structures. You can generate a 
    network structure GIF graph with a line subgraph and a bar 
    subgraph by seting some basic parameters. The line subgraph
    describes the total number of nodes in the infected state at 
    different times. The bar subgraph describes the growth of number
    of infected nodes in current time and last time in different times.
